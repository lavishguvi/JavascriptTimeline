## Project Description
This project is a timeline-based shopping cart interface. It displays a list of items with their corresponding year and description. The timeline layout creates an interactive and visually appealing shopping experience. As the user scrolls, the items in view are highlighted, creating a smooth transition effect.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the shopping cart.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styling rules to format the appearance of the shopping cart.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for adding the "in-view" class to the items in the viewport and creating the scroll animation effect.



## Instructions
To use the shopping cart, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository:
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Scroll through the page to see the timeline effect.
4. As you scroll, the items in view will be highlighted with a different background color.
5. The timeline creates a smooth transition effect for an interactive shopping experience.
